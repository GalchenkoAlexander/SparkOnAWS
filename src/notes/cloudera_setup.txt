### Step 1 - Create 1 EC2 instance
# AMI: ami-0a559a73
# Instance type: c4.large
# Instance count: 1
# Root volume - 8GB

### Step 2 - Verify log into the instance
# Change permissions to your key:
chmod 600 <key-name>.pem
# Log in to instances as centos user:
ssh -i <path-to-key>.pem centos@<public_ip>

### Step 3 - Prepare the instance
# Download JDK 1.8 rpm from Oracle official site or from Google doc

# Copy JDK to instance:
scp -i <path-to-key>.pem jdk-8u144-linux-x64.rpm centos@<public_ip>:/home/centos

# Log in to the instance:
ssh -i <path-to-key>.pem centos@<public_ip>

# Install JDK:
sudo yum -y localinstall jdk-8u144-linux-x64.rpm

# Install wget:
sudo yum -y install wget

### Step 4 - Install Cloudera Director
# Install cloudera-director repository:
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo wget "https://archive.cloudera.com/director/redhat/7/x86_64/director/cloudera-director.repo"

# Install Cloudera Director server and client by running the following command:
sudo yum -y install cloudera-director-server cloudera-director-client

# Start the Cloudera Director server by running the following command:
sudo service cloudera-director-server start

# If the RHEL 7 or CentOS firewall is running on the EC2 instance where you have installed Cloudera Director, disable and stop the firewall with the following commands:
sudo systemctl disable firewalld
sudo systemctl stop firewalld

### Step 5 - Connect to SOCKS5 proxy
## Configure proxy tunnel
# Linux
nohup ssh -i <path-to-key>.pem -CND 8157 centos@<public_ip> &
# Win Putty/Connection/SSH/Tunnels -> Source Post/8157/Dynamic

## Log in to Chrome using the tunnel:
# Linux
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
--user-data-dir="$HOME/chrome-with-proxy" --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:8157"
# WIN
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:8157"

## Log in to Cloudera Director:
http://<private_ip>:7189
